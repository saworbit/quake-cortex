# Archived Hybrid Assets

This folder contains legacy hybrid (Python/IPC) scripts and configs that were
moved out of the root to keep the pure QuakeC bot cleanly separated.

- `scripts/` - legacy hybrid launchers and helpers
- `Game/cortex/` - legacy hybrid config files

For active hybrid experiments, see `hybrids/fteqw/` and `hybrids/darkplaces/`.
