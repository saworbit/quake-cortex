# Project Cortex - Python Dependencies

# Phase 1: Data Pipeline (Current)
# No required dependencies - runs with standard library only!

# Note on Python versions (Windows):
# - The core Brain/telemetry scripts run on modern Python (including 3.14+).
# - Optional packages like pygame / RL stacks often lag new Python releases with wheels.
#   If `pip install` tries to build from source and fails, use Python 3.11/3.12 in a venv.

# Phase 3: RL Training (Gymnasium + Stable Baselines 3)
gymnasium==0.29.1; python_version < "3.14"
stable-baselines3==2.2.1; python_version < "3.14"
numpy>=1.21.0; python_version < "3.14"
shimmy>=0.2.0; python_version < "3.14"

# Optional extras:
# - Visualization: see `python/requirements-visualizer.txt`
